# Contentment Ideas

## Data Editors

- TinyMCE - push the boundaries beyond Umbraco's defaults?
  - How's about a TinyMCE that is 30px height, Distraction Free mode, all menu items disabled.
  - Only keyboard shortcuts would be enabled. Try to make it become a single-line rich-textbox.

- Text Input - Change Font-Size within Input Field Based on Length (similar to Facebook's post experience, after 85 chars)

- Nested Content - Reimagined. Reach for its heart, imagine a new landscape, another atmosphere, and see how it goes.
